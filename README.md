DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previous memory benchmarking tools such as STREAM/STREAM2, lmbench3, and mlc all had various shortcomings that made them inadequate for emerging needs in the cloud. In particular, cloud systems present four key challenges that we addressed with X-Mem. Stay tuned for updates -- more information will be coming soon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tool is provided as open source with the hope of being useful to the broader research and development community. Here are some of X-Mem's features.

Flexibility: Easy reconfiguration for different combinations of tests
- Working sets in increments of 4KB, allowing cache up to main memory-level benchmarking
- NUMA support
- Multi-threading support
- Large page support

Extensibility: Modularity via C++ object-oriented principles
- Supports rapid addition of new benchmark kernel routines
- Example: stream triad algorithm, impact of false sharing, etc. are possible with minor changes

Cross-platform: Currently implemented for two OSes and architecture families
- Windows: Intel x86 (32-bit), x86-64, and x86-64 with AVX extensions
- GNU/Linux: Intel x86 (32-bit), x86-64, and x86-64 with AVX extensions, ARM (32-bit), ARM (32-bit) with NEON, ARMv8 (64-bit)
- Designed to allow straightforward porting to other operating systems and ISAs
- ARM on Windows currently not possible due to some incompatibilites and/or lack of support. This may be resolved in the future.

Memory throughput:
- Accurate measurement of sustained memory throughput to all levels of cache and memory
- Regular access patterns: forward & reverse sequential as well as strides of 2, 4, 8, and 16 words
- Random access patterns
- Read and write
- 32, 64, 128, 256-bit width memory instructions where applicable on each architecture

Memory latency: 
- Accurate measurement of round-trip memory latency to all levels of cache and memory
- Loaded and unloaded latency via use of multithreaded load generation

Memory power:
- Support custom power instrumentation through a simple interface that end-users can implement
- Can collect DRAM power via custom driver exposed in Windows performance counter API

Documentation:
- Extensive Doxygen source code comments, PDF manual, HTML


INCLUDED EXTENSIONS (under src/include/ext and src/ext directories):
- Loaded latency benchmark variant with load delays inserted as nop instructions between memory instructions.
	- This is done for 32, 64, 128, and 256-bit load chunk sizes where applicable using the forward sequential read pattern.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNTIME PREREQUISITES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few runtime prerequisites in order for the software to run correctly.

HARDWARE:

- Intel x86, x86-64, or x86-64 with AVX CPU. AMD CPUs should also work although this has not been tested!
- ARM Cortex-A series processors with VFP and NEON extensions. Specifically tested on ARM Cortex A9 (32-bit) which is ARMv7. 64-bit builds for ARMv8-A should also work but have not been tested. GNU/Linux builds only. You can attempt Windows, but I have issues linking the 32-bit version and compiling the NEON version. Also, as far as I can see there is no Windows support for ARMv8 at all.

WINDOWS:

- Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-bit or later, Server 2012 R2 or later.
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributables (32-bit) -- for x86 (32-bit) builds
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributables (64-bit) -- for x86-64 and x86-64 with AVX builds
- You MAY need Administrator privileges, in order to:
    - Use large pages, if the --large_pages option is selected (see USAGE, below)
    - The first time you use --large_pages on a given Windows machine, you may need to ensure that your Windows user account has the necessary rights to allow lockable memory pages. To do this on Windows 8, run gpedit.msc --> Local Computer Policy --> Computer Configuration --> Windows Settings --> Security Settings --> Local Policies --> User Rights Assignment --> Add your username to "Lock pages in memory". Then log out and then log back in.
    - Use the PowerReader interface, depending on end-user implementation
    - Elevate thread priority and pin threads to logical CPUs for improved performance and benchmarking consistency

GNU/LINUX:

- GNU utilities with support for C++11. Tested with gcc 4.8.2 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for x86 (32-bit), x86-64, and x86-64 with AVX on Intel Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, and Haswell families.
- libhugetlbfs. You can obtain it at <http://libhugetlbfs.sourceforge.net>. On Ubuntu systems, you can install using "sudo apt-get install libhugetlbfs0".
- Potentially, administrator privileges, if you plan to use the --large_pages option.
    - During runtime, if the --large_pages option is selected, you may need to first manually ensure that large pages are available from the OS. This can be done by running "hugeadm --pool-list". It is recommended to set minimum pool to 1GB (in order to measure DRAM effectively). If needed, this can be done by running "hugeadm --pool-pages-min 2MB:512". Alternatively, run the linux_setup_runtime_hugetlbfs.sh script that is provided with X-Mem. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only file that is needed to run on Windows is the respective executable xmem-win-<ARCH>.exe on Windows, and xmem-linux-<ARCH> on GNU/Linux. It has no other dependencies aside from the pre-installed system prerequisites listed above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get help using the tool, simply run it with the "-h" or "--help" option. It includes a list of all available options and provides usage examples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING FROM SOURCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you have set the desired compile-time options, build the source. On Windows, running build-win.bat should suffice. On GNU/Linux, run build-linux.sh. Each takes a single argument specifying the target architecture.

If you customize your build, make sure you use the "Release" mode for your OS/compiler. Do not include debug capabilities as it can dramatically affect performance of the benchmarks, leading to pessimistic results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD PREREQUISITES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few software build prerequisites, depending on your platform.

WINDOWS:

- Any version of Visual Studio 2013 64-bit (also known as version 12.0).
- Python 2.7. You can obtain it at <http://www.python.org>.
- SCons build system. You can obtain it at <http://www.scons.org>. Build tested with SCons 2.3.4.

GNU/LINUX:

- bash shell. Other shells could work but are untested.
- gcc with support for the C++11 standard. Tested with gcc version 4.8.2 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for x86 (32-bit), x86-64, x86-64 with AVX builds.
- gcc cross-compiler for ARM targets (assumed build on x86-64 Ubuntu host).
- Python 2.7. You can obtain it at <http://www.python.org>. On Ubuntu systems, you can install using "sudo apt-get install python2.7". You may need some other Python 2.7 packages as well.
- SCons build system. You can obtain it at <http://www.scons.org>. On Ubuntu systems, you can install using "sudo apt-get install scons". Build tested with SCons 2.3.4.
- Kernel support for large (huge) pages. This support can be verified on your Linux installation by running "grep hugetlbfs /proc/filesystems". If you do not have huge page support in your kernel, you can build a kernel with the appropriate options switched on: "CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE" and "CONFIG_HUGETLBFS".
- libhugetlbfs. This is used for allocating large (huge) pages if the --large_pages runtime option is selected. You can obtain it at <http://libhugetlbfs.sourceforge.net>. On Ubuntu systems, you can install using "sudo apt-get install libhugetlbfs-dev".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCUMENTATION BUILD PREREQUISITES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tools are only needed for automatically regenerating source code documentation with HTML and PDF.

WINDOWS:

- doxygen tool. You can obtain it at <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen>.
- LaTeX distribution. You can get a Windows distribution at <http://www.miktex.org>.
- make for Windows. You can obtain it at <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm>. You will have to manually add it to your Windows path.

GNU/LINUX:

- doxygen tool. You can obtain it at <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen>. On Ubuntu systems, you can install with "sudo apt-get install doxygen".
- LaTeX distribution. On Ubuntu systems, LaTeX distributed with doxygen should actually be sufficient. You can install with "sudo apt-get install doxygen-latex".
- make. This should be included on any GNU/Linux system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tool comes with built-in Doxygen comments in the source code, which can be used to generate both HTML and LaTeX --> PDF documentation. Documentation is maintained under the doc/ subdirectory. To build documentation after modifying the source, run build-docs-win.bat on Windows, or build-docs-linux.sh on GNU/Linux systems. Note that Doxygen and a LaTeX distribution must be installed on the system.
